      Headspace went through another round of cuts to get towards profitability, including cuts to active therapists immediately severing their established care relationships.
      No word on whether the layoffs included free stress counciling from Headspace.

      As another effort in the year of efficiency Zuckerberg made significant cuts in his VR boondoggle, probably to appease complaining investors as add revenues have been impacted.
      A likely casualty of these cuts is the project to add legs to VR avatars.

      Perhaps concluding that it could make a reskin of last years game with much fewer people, EA announced that it would layoff about 6% of its workforce who were "not contributing to the strategy"

      Possbily due to the saturation of the market for $100,000+ EV cars along with a potential drop in demand due to "macro economic conditions," Lucid decided that the best way to hit production
      targets was to remove some of the workforce. I'm not sure that was the lession that was supposed to be be taken from the "Mythical Man-Month."

      Evernote was one of the first Silicon Valley "Unicorns" (private companies that were worth more than $1bn). I used to be a paid user of their subscription
      services, but like most others started finding it less useful as time went on and stopped paying. A darling no more, Evernote has been in a steady decline.

      Touted as a friendly Uber, Lyft has always been second fiddle in the driver gig space. Though they have expanded into other forms of mobility,
      they continue to be a low margin business that relies on investment to sustain operations.

      Started at Harvard by Mark Zuckerberg to creep on co-eds then work out his Machiavellian desires, Facebook is now the largest social network in the world far eclipsing Nextdoor's ability to 
      amplify the racist ramblings of angry old people. Exceeding its original vision, Facebook has created platforms for younger, attention starved influencers (Instagram) and 
      an even better way for old people to spread misinformation and racist rants (Whatsapp).

      An early pioneer in home video gaming, Electronic Arts has had the most success recently by offering the same game with updated stats year after year through its sport franchises. Not
      satisfied with this mechanism of "extracting value" the company has recently moved to add as many microtransactions as possible to further blur the lines between gaming and work.

      Another EV car startup, Lucid started delivering their high-priced, high-powered cars in 2022. Plagued supply chain issues and demand, output has been far lower than expectations thus far.
